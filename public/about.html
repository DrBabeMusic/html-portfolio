<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an award-winning educator and music producer who has owned and operated a restaurant
  in Lead, SD. I began as an 8th grade math teacher in 2010 and quickly became the Math
  Department Chair, leading a team of 7th and 8th grade teachers. I then became an instructional
  coach for the math and science department, as well as a Response To Intervention (RTI)
  coordinator, where I was responsible for overseeing educational and behavioral deficiencies in
  students throughout the entire student population. I currently lead the Algebra department,
  teaching 8th grade Algebra, and am ready and eager for the next step in my career.</p>

<p>Since I was in high school, I’ve had a gift of bringing people together, whether it was organizing a camping trip, throwing a party, or learning how to jam with someone so that they can shine and the music can flow.  There is a very unique bond that occurs when you get in a flow state with someone else musically and something organic pours out.  I am at a stage in my life where I am feeling called to dig deeper and explore my gifts to the fullest potential, and to me that is bringing people together on an emotional level.  Through releasing music publicly I am opening myself up to hopefully feel more relatable to others so they can connect on an emotional level, let’s call it emotional networking.</p>
<p>I love playing music, painting, and the arts in general, and I want to do what I can to continue playing music while supporting other’s talents as well.  I want to create a place where like-minded creatives can have an avenue to share, collaborate, or just exist together.  We have so many friends that are amazing artists, authors, and movie directors, and we want to be able to collaborate with them while also providing a space to showcase their work as well.  Very few of us would be where we are without the help of others and we want to embrace that.  I am learning how to do web design so that we can create a path for us that we want, such as making music videos, producing albums, promoting other artists, designing band posters, etc.</p>
<p>That goal is to create The Ayurvedic Collective; a source of good things to consume in a variety of ways that allows us and our friends to share our gifts to the world in a positive and healing way.  Ayurveda is the knowledge of life and focuses on what the senses take in on every level; visually, auditorial, orally, physically, mentally, and emotionally.  Ayurveda is about cultivating joy in life and finding balance that works for each person individually.</p>
